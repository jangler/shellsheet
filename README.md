# Shellsheet

REPL/sheet + spreadsheet hybrid. Development status: pre-alpha, messing around.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

GitHub Pages builds are handled via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
